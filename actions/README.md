## FAQ:

1. Why are some mods outdated?

- Mostly they have been merged with others you can find on this page.

2. Are all mods made by myself?

- Not all! Sometimes I'm just editing some stuff that makes it better and leave a comment who was the original creator.

3. Where do I get my ideas?

- Mostly it's stuff that I was dreaming of when I started using DBM or a suggestion from a user that nobody is looking at.
